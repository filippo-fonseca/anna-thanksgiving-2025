There’s a steadiness I feel around you
that still surprises me.
Something quiet,
something bright,
something that settles into me
the way sunlight settles on a windowsill—
soft, certain, unforced.

What we have…

It hasn’t been long.
But every time I see you,
something in me lifts.
You make the day feel warmer,
clearer,
a little more like myself.

And somehow,
in the small rituals we share—
a walk, a glance, a run, a study session—
I feel this quiet truth forming:

I’m grateful for you.
For who you are,
for the light you carry,
for the way being with you
already feels like something real.

That’s all I wanted to say.
Simple, true, and steady:
I’m grateful for you.

My dearest Anna,

I have tried to write this letter three times. Each time I
start, I can hear your voice in my mind—gentle, thoughtful,
full of that steady warmth that seems stitched into the way
you look at the world. And so I will begin honestly, simply,
the way you do:

I am grateful for you—not as an ornament to my days, but as my
partner in them.

You wrote about how we met, about the smallness and strangeness
of the moment that turned into everything. I think about it
often. I think about how quietly our lives clicked into place,
how natural it felt—how natural it still feels. I’ve said this
before, but I mean it more each time: We are a team in a way I
didn’t know I was allowed to hope for.

I love the way you approach the world—your devotion to your
work, the tenderness you carry toward every story, every
person, every place you stop long enough to see. You make
meaning where others rush past. You, in your earnestness and
intelligence and vulnerability, remind me every day what it
looks like to build a life with intention. You inspire me—not
in some abstract sense, but in the exact, immediate way the
sun, mirroring your golden hair, inspires a flower to open. I
feel that warmth every time I see you. It never gets old. And
I’m certain it never will.

Your letter spoke of noticing; of learning someone’s contours
until love becomes a kind of literacy. I want you to know… I
read you, too. I read the strength behind your softness; the
courage behind your doubts; the way you carry beauty in the
structures of your sentences and in the choices you make when
no one is watching. I read the quiet resilience, the humor,
the grace, the fire. I see all of it. I love all of it.

And I am proud of you. Proud of the way we, in the short time
we’ve known each other, can care for each other. Proud of the
partnership that has formed between us—not fragile, not
tentative, but steady and forward-moving. It feels genuine.

If there is one truth I want this letter to hold, it is this:

I am grateful for you not in passing, not in metaphor, not as
faint praise, but as the unmistakable source of so much of
what brings light into my life.

*P.S. I hope this wasn't too much. Said this before, but I don't want to seem over-glamorous, fake, or public enemy #1... clingy. This is genuinely how I feel, and I'm not ashamed to share it. :)

With love, always,
Filippo
